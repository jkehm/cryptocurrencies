# Module 19/Cryptocurrencies

### Purpose
In this module we learned about Unsupervised Machine Learning. 

* Describe the differences between supervised and unsupervised learning, including real-world examples of each.
* Preprocess data for unsupervised learning.
* Cluster data using the K-means algorithm.
* Determine the best number of centroids for K-means using the elbow curve.
* Use PCA to limit features and speed up the model.

In this challenge the four deliverables were
1. Preprocessing the Data for PCA
2. Reducing Data Dimensions Using PCA
3. Clustering Cryptocurrencies Using K-Means
4. Visualizing Cryptocurrencies Results
